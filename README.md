# Human_Detection_In_Crowd
Repository contains scripts that were created during master's thesis "Detection of a human pose in a crowd". The subject of the paper concerns the field of computer vision, more specifically the detection of a human figure located in a crowd of people, in urban conditions. The goal was to perform a comparison of available solutions. Both classical and neural network based methods were considered. It was decided to study the HOG descriptor along with the SVM linear classifier, two versions of the YOLO algorithm: the third and eighth, and Faster R-CNN. Experiments were conducted using the ShanghaiTech database.

Here are examples of comparisons containing sensitivity value and time of detections

And also one of the charts describing sensitivity as a function of people count
